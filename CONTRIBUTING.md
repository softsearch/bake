# Contributing

All PRs are merged to develop branch first. DO NOT branch of master. Master contains production code only

*NOTE: Always branch of develop*

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and etc.
   
2. You can use micro commits but commits are squashed upon merge to a macro commit that explains what you've been doing ,i'e the feature/bug/enhancement that you've been working on
